This Android application is developed using Android Studio and Kotlin.
It manages basic authentication with two user types: instructor and student.
Instructors can view the sections they are teaching, including information about the students enrolled in each section.
Students can register for sections.
If a section is full, students have the option to join the waitlist.
When a student who is enrolled in the section drops the course, the first student on the waitlist is automatically enrolled.
Students can also view the courses they are taking and can easily drop a course or remove themselves from a waitlist.

How to Run

Place api.php into your XAMPP htdocs directory.
(Path: xampp/htdocs/api.php)
Import db2.sql into your database.
Create a new database named DB2.
Run the db2.sql script inside that database.
Ensure that your Android app can communicate with the API through your local server (e.g., http://localhost/api.php).
